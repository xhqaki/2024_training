Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you
last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the 
sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other,
that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honor and humanity, 
ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.Wilfully
and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged 
favorite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than 
on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be 
adepravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the 
severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting
each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the
following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the 
explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of 
relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am 
sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
